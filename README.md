# Web Scraping NYU Langone Primary Care Providers

I built a web scraper in Python to extract structured data from NYU Langone’s Primary Care Doctors directory — names, specialties, locations, and scheduling info. Using the lightweight but powerful requests library, I fetched the web page content efficiently. Then, the json library helped parse structured portions of data when available, turning raw HTML into a clean dataset ready for analysis and search.

Combining these libraries demonstrates how simple it can be to unlock public healthcare data and make it more accessible for network analysis or patient matching without dealing with sensitive information.

For data scientists and engineers working in healthcare analytics, this project highlights how fundamental Python tools like requests and json provide a practical foundation for impactful scraping and data integration projects.
